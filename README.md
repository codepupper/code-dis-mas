## How to set it up:

1. Install the requirements using `npm i` or install them manutally by using `npm i discord.js && npm i mastodon-api`
2. Create a bot on [Discord's Developer Portal](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/)
3. Switch to your Mastodon Instance and generate a Application under the Development Tab in the Settings
4. Name your Application, fill everything out and save your `access_token`, `client_secret`, and `client_key` somewhere
5. Rename `example-config.json` to `config.json` and replace the values with your your Information

### Example Config
```json

    "prefix": "-",
